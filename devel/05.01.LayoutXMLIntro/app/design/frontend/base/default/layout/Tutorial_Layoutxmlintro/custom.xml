    Here go update handles, direct (immediate) descendants of <layout> node


    Autogenerated update handles are:

    <STORE_...>  -  <STORE_default>, <STORE_german>, <STORE_french>, etc.
                    The suffix is Store Code.

    <THEME_..._..._...>  -  <THEME_frontend_rwd_default>, <THEME_frontend_rwd_dyslexia>, etc.
                            The suffix is Areaname_Packagename_Themename.

    <[Full Action Name]>  -  <catalog_product_view>, <Tutorial_Layoutxmlintro_index_layout>, etc
                             The entity is RouteName_controllername_actionname.
                             Here RouteNames are catalog, Tutorial_Layoutxmlintro
                             RouteName is exactly what one defines in config.xml under <routers> node
